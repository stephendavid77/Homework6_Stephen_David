# SwiftUI 3x3 Grid App

This is a simple SwiftUI project that displays a 3x3 grid of numbered circles over a full-screen background image. It demonstrates basic layout concepts in SwiftUI using `ZStack`, `VStack`, `HStack`, and `ForEach`.

---

## ðŸ“¸ Preview

The UI includes:
- A full-screen background image.
- A grid of 9 circles (numbered 1 to 9).
- Circles are semi-transparent and centered in the screen.

---

## ðŸ›  Features

- Full-screen background using `.resizable()`, `.scaledToFill()`, and `.edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)`.
- 3x3 grid layout created with nested `VStack` and `HStack`.
- Each circle is filled with white at 80% opacity.
- Numbers are dynamically generated based on the row and column index.

---

## ðŸ’¡ SwiftUI Concepts Used

- `ZStack` â€“ for layering the background and grid.
- `VStack` and `HStack` â€“ for building a grid layout.
